This was a project I did in one of my classes, called Quantitative Analysis, while in school.

  I was given the task to find data that I could bring together to describe how they relate to 
each other. 

  This proccess took around a month to learn:
1) Where to get data and how to clean the data using Excel.
2) To use RStudio software and the coding for what I needed it to do.
3) How to interpret the results I got from the data I pulled and present it to an audience.
